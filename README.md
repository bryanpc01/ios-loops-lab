}
````

    print(number)
}
```

```swift
for number in 19...51 where !(number % 2 == 0){
    print(number)
}
```

```swift
for number in 1..<100 where (number % 10 == 5){
    print(number)

```

***

```swift
for number in 1...40 where (number % 10 == 7){
    print(number)
}
```

***
## Question 7

Given a range of numbers from 20 to 150 inclusive, print out all the numbers that follows these conditions:

`Numbers that are divisible by 3`

```swift
for number in 20...150 where (number % 3 == 0){
    print(number)
}
```

***
## Question 8

`Numbers that are divisible by 2 and 3`

```swift
for number in 20...150 where (number % 6 == 0){
    print(number)
}
```

***

`Numbers that end with a 4`

```swift
for number in 20...150 where (number % 10 == 4){
    print(number)
}
```

***
## Question 10

Given a range of numbers from 20 to 150, print out all the numbers that follows these conditions:

`Print out numbers: 31, 35, 40 to 60.`

```swift
for number in 20...150 where (number == 31 || number == 35 || number == 40 || number == 60 ){
    print(number)
}
```

***
## Question 11

Without using Xcode, how many times will the loop below run?  Explain why.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}
```
**This is an infinite loop. The while condition is true at run time and there is no logic to halt the loop**

***
## Question 12

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing when i reaches 9.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    if i == 9 {break}
    i += 1
}
```

***
## Question 13

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing after it has run 1,000 times.

```swift
var i = 5
let numberOfTimesToRun = 1000
let whenToHalt = numberOfTimesToRun + i

while (i > 3) {
    if i == whenToHalt {break}
    i += 1
}
```

***
## Question 14

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing after it has run 1,000 times and also make it print out the current value of i **only if i is an even number.**

```swift
var i = 5
let numberOfTimesToRun = 1000
let whenToHalt = numberOfTimesToRun + i

while (i > 3) {
    if i == whenToHalt {break}
    i += 1
}

if i % 2 == 0 {print(i)}
```

***
## Question 15

What's the difference in syntax between the following two while loops?  Will their outputs be different?  Explain why or why not.

```swift
var i = 1
//loop one
while i <= 10 {
    print("i = \(i)")
    i += 1
}

//loop two
var i = 1

repeat {
    print("i = \(i)")
    i += 1
} while i <= 10
```
**Loop one checks if the condition is true before executing the body of the loop continuing until the condition is false.**

**Loop two executes the body of the loop and then checks to continue looping or not.**

**Both loops will have the same output because both loops share a condition that is initially true.**

***
## Question 16

What's the difference between `break` and `continue`?  Give an example that demonstrates their differences.

**Break: leaves the loop when this is called. Use when you want to exit a loop**

**Continue: leaves the current iteration of the loop. Use when you want to skip the running of code at a particular point in a loop.**

***
## Question 17

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print? Select all that apply.

```swift
for i in 1...10 {
    if (i >= 4 && i <= 7){
        continue
    }
    print(i)
}
```

- [x] 1
- [x] 2
- [x] 3
- [ ] 4
- [ ] 5
- [ ] 6
- [ ] 7
- [x] 8
- [x] 9
- [x] 10

***
## Question 18

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print? Select all that apply.

```swift
for i in 1...10 {
    if (i >= 4 && i <= 7){
        break
    }
    print(i)
}
```

- [x] 1
- [x] 2
- [x] 3
- [ ] 4
- [ ] 5
- [ ] 6
- [ ] 7
- [ ] 8
- [ ] 9
- [ ] 10

***
## Question 19

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print?  Explain below.

```swift
outerloop: for x in 1...3 {
    innerloop: for y in 1...3 {
        if y == 2{
            continue outerloop
        }
        print("x = \(x), y = \(y)")
    }
}
```

x = 1, y = 1

x = 2, y = 1

x = 3, y = 1

**The inner loop does not go pass one iteration because the continue to outerloop when y == 2 prevents it.**

***
## Question 20

Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) **where** x and y are both integers.

```swift
for x in 0...10 {
    for y in 0...10 {
        print((x,y))
    }
}
```

***
## Question 21

Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) **where** the difference of x and y is at least 5, and x and y are both integers.

```swift
for x in 0...10 {
    for y in 0...10 {
        if (x - y > 5) || (y - x > 5) {
            print((x,y))
        }
    }
}
```

***
## Question 22

Print the first `N` square numbers. A **square number**, also called perfect square, is an integer that is obtained by squaring some other integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself (ex. 1 = 1*1, 4 = 2 * 2, 9 = 3* 3 â€¦).

Example:
Input: `var N = 5`

Output:
```swift
1
4
9
16
25
```
```swift
for n in 1...N {
    print(n * n)
}
```
***
## Question 23

Given an integer N draw a square of N x N asterisks. Look at the examples.

Example 1:
Input: `var N = 2`

Output:
```swift
**
**
```

Example 2:
Input: `var N = 3`

Output:
```swift
***

***
```

Hint 1
Try printing a single line of * first.

Hint 2
You can use print("") to print an empty line.

```swift
var xLine = ""

for _ in 1...N {
    for _ in 1...N {
        xLine += "*"
    }
    print(xLine)
    xLine = ""
}
```
